                <p>The Tax and Regulatory practice is developed around the needs of the clients who are looking for quality advice and service, both locally and internationally. As tax laws have become more complex, it is essential to ensure that businesses having cross border transactions, undertake tax planning at an early stage to manage global tax risks. At the same time compliance is essential as required under Indian Regulations governed by Reserve Bank of India, SEBI, Ministry of Corporate Affairs amongst others for various matters of approvals and ongoing compliances.
